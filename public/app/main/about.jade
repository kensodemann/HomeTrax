	p.
		HomeTrax is a program for tracking various things about life.  I got tired of going to one app for my
		calendar, another app for todo lists, and yet another app for keeping track of the money in my
		checking account.  This application combines all of that, plus any other common personal item.
	p.
		I was also interested in learning more about writing SPAs with AngularJS, writing server side code
		in JavaScript using NodeJS, and storing data in MongoDB.  This application was written to allow me
		to explore those technologies.
