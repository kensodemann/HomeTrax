	p.
		HomeTrax is a program for tracking various things about life.  Specifically for keeping track of things I
		am always needing to look up that I don't really track anywhere else. Mostly stuff about my house.

		I was also interested in learning more about writing SPAs with AngularJS, writing server side code
		in JavaScript using NodeJS, and storing data in MongoDB.  This application was written to allow me
		to explore those technologies.
